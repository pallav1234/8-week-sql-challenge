# 🗃️ 8-Week SQL Challenge – Portfolio

Welcome! This is a comprehensive portfolio of my solutions to the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/). 

Each case study dives into realistic business scenarios and is solved using clean, practical SQL. The goal is to showcase my ability to analyze data, write performant queries, and derive insights to support decision-making.
