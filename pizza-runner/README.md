In the **Pizza Runner** case study, we help Danny streamline operations for his pizza delivery startup. This project showcases real-world SQL skills to clean, join, and analyze messy delivery and order data — while simulating how a data analyst would assist a fast-moving business in decision-making.

You’ll see:
- Practical SQL queries to fix and transform raw operational data

🔍 This project highlights my data cleaning, transformation, and storytelling capabilities in a business context.
